# CV-template-pure-HTML-CSS
My pure HTML CSS CV template that I use currently to apply 
The main aim was first to code my own cv by my self by using basic but powerfull function of css 3 , in other worlds, flexbox and gridbox , it is still one thing to do which is to render 
the banner of "technical skill" responsive in the fondamental browser google chrome but anyway , in all cases , it wasn't a problem for me as I use the cv only for applying so I just convert
the template into a png file then a PDF file .
